# k8s-postgresql-fastapi-performance üöÄ

A hands-on project for learning performance tuning concepts by optimizing a common web stack: FastAPI, PostgreSQL, and Kubernetes. The goal is to systematically identify bottlenecks and measure the impact of optimizations on the system's maximum Queries Per Second (QPS).

## üéØ Project Goal

The primary objective is to **maximize the QPS** a single FastAPI application pod can handle for a user profile API. The project intentionally avoids horizontal scaling (adding more pods) to force optimization of the application, database, and underlying resource configuration.

We will benchmark two primary workload types:
* **Read-Heavy:** 90% read operations (fetch user profile) and 10% write operations (update user email).
* **Write-Heavy:** 10% read operations and 90% write operations.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture

The architecture consists of three main components running in a Kubernetes cluster:

1.  **FastAPI Application:** A Python application serving a simple `/users/{user_id}` API with GET (read) and PATCH (write) methods.
2.  **PostgreSQL Database:** A single PostgreSQL instance that stores the `users` table. The FastAPI application communicates with this database.
3.  **Load Generator:** A separate pod (e.g., using Locust, k6, or JMeter) that runs on a different node to simulate user traffic and measure QPS, latency, and error rates. This ensures the load generator's resource consumption does not interfere with the application's performance.
